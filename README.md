# Portfolio v1

> I made this portfolio a long time ago, when I was just an Android developer.
> I saw this cool vanilla HTML/CSS template, and decided to modify it to my own color and design.
> The final design turned out to be a bit classic, and I think it holds up to this day.
>
> I'm currently working on my next personal landing site using Astro + Tailwind CSS.
> As a warm-up, I thought I would migrate the current one first, then build the new one on top of it.
> But I ended up rewriting the whole thing, and it turned out to be a lot of fun as it reminded me how web development has changed over the years.
